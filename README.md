# ProgrammingLanguageConcepts_Java-lisp-interpreter

This was the final assignment for Programming Language Concepts, and used starter code from Andruw Vitkus' repository, which was the 'skeleton' of a LISP interpreter. Code in src/lisp was created by me to add new functionality. The .jar on which the project is dependent is an extensively trimmed version of that provided.
