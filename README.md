# ProgrammingLanguageConcepts_Java-lisp-interpreter

This was the final assignment for Programming Language Concepts, and used starter code from Andruw Vitkus' repository, which was the 'skeleton' of a LISP interpreter. Code in src/lisp and the LISP test file were created by me to add and test new functionality. The .jar on which the project is dependent is an extensively trimmed version of that provided.
